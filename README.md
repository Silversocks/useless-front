# Useless

simplifying life at the click of a button

## How to Use

just press the button, whenever you feel overwhelmed by emails

## what this is

this is a somewhat simple app that handles all your unread emails, with the press of a single button. However, as they say, there is no such thing as a free lunch. 

## the roulette feature

the creator of this app felt this was too useful of an app. thus, he added a little twist. every time the button is pressed, there is at least a 1 in 6 chance for it to deploy a custom workflow of OSINT agents, supplemented with a web scraper, to find out all possible details about the reciever of the email. this data is used to craft dangerous, unprofessional, insulting emails to the sender, instead of the regular reply to the email. 

every time you press the button, you play russian roulette with your social life. no sane person wants to do that, making this the ultimate useless app.
